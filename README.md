# CSharp8Features
Project to test out the latest features released in C#8 


How do you know whether a parameter you're passing or a result you're receiving can be null? With nullable reference types in C# 8.0 the answer is no longer "read the documentation": It's right there in the code, and C# will tell you when a null goes where it's not supposed to go. We'll look at the feature and how to embrace it in your own code.
